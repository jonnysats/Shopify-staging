		We do this to reference in the right sequence the settings from the drawer cart in hte drawer cart section
		? NOTE: Since this section is using the "drawer-cart" snippet only, 
		?		any theme setting nested in another snippet inside "drawer cart" snippet is lost to the section
		?		for example, the drawer cart theme settings inside "drawer-cart-upsell" snippet (nested inside "/snippet/drawer-cart.liquid")
