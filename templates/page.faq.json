We strongly encourage ordering samples before placing a full order so you can experience the material’s color and texture in person. For best results, view samples in the actual installation space, as lighting can significantly affect tone. While we do our best to ship all samples together, some may ship separately if certain items are temporarily out of stock. For additional questions, please email support@renosource.co or schedule a consultation appointment. "

Orders are delivered palletized to the curb only. Boxes typically weigh 35–60 lbs each, so please plan ahead for assistance in moving materials from the curb to your space, as drivers are not permitted to bring materials inside or assist beyond curbside drop-off. Delivery timelines are estimates and may vary based on location and carrier availability. The carrier will confirm the final delivery window once your shipment is ready for local delivery."

If your shipment arrives with damaged or missing items, we’re here to help. Please inspect your delivery at the time it arrives, before signing the delivery receipt. If you notice any visible damage or shortages: Clearly note the issue on the delivery receipt before signing. Take photos of the damage while the driver is present. Failure to document damage at delivery may prevent us from filing a freight claim with the carrier. If damage is discovered, please contact Reno Source within 48 hours of delivery with the following: Your order number. The quantity of damaged material. Clear photos of the damaged items and packaging. Once received, we’ll work quickly to evaluate the claim and coordinate replacements for any items damaged in transit. Please note that freight carriers only allow one claim per shipment, and claims reported after the 48-hour window cannot be processed. Do not refuse deliveries with damaged product. Usually the vast majority of the material is still usable and only a small portion is damaged. "
